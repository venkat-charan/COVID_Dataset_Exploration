# COVID_Dataset_Exploration

## Description
Exploring Coronavirus data to find relationship between deaths and other factors. I have extracted USA GDP , Population , Literacy and Protests data from various sources and tried to find a relationship with the Coronavirus deaths in USA.

## Data Sources

Coronavirus - <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/api"> Covid tracking API </a><br>
Protests - <a href="https://countlove.org/"> Countlove</a>

## Built With

Google Colab - Online Jupyter Notebook<br>
Tableau - Data Visualisation Software

## Results

I have found a strong logarithmic relationship between the number of attendees in protests and the deaths in the United States. The p-value of the data is below 0.0001 which means that the result is very significant and a r-value of 0.399 indicating a strong relationship between the two features.
